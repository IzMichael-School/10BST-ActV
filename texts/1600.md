The 17th century saw much controversy in Christianity. In 1610, Galileo published Sidereus Nuncius, which explained his findings with a new telescope. These findings were in direct conflict with what the Christians of the time believed about the heavens. This led to Galileo being persecuted. Christians in America became very wary of 'witches'. The Salem witch trials began in 1692, and led to many women being killed. Many Christian vessels became involved in the Atlantic Slave Trade, with many slaves being transported into Christian homes.
