The Second Great Awakening was a period between 1790 and the 1830's in which Protestant churches were gaining supporters and spreading across America. This revival led to gatherings thousands of people attended for worship and preaching. This as a side note was one of the first black participation in Christian religion and gave more public roles for women. The English Church during the 1800's became more and more a minority, as other churches began forming and more Protestant churches began to be recognized as a part of Christianity. The Church of England concluded the century as it started it, the majority church.
