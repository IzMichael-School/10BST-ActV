In the 1500's the Roman Catholic Church was most prominent throughout Europe. Anyone who disagreed with their teachings were staked and burnt alive. The church relied on money, which lead to Martin Luther standing up for the people. In England, Henry VIII married Catherine of Aragon, who gave birth to a daughter. Henry VIII thought if he had no son to be his heir, civil war would break out. He asked the Pope for a divorce, so he could remarry, but the pope refused. Henry VIII had to leave the Catholic church to remarry, so Henry VIII had Parliament pass laws that allowed each prince to choose what church their followers were a part of. This allowed Henry VIII to divorce from his wife without spiritual repercussions. This formed the Church of England, which split from the wider Catholic Church.
