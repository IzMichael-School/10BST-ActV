In the 1700s, the Catholic Church was in a precarious situation throughout Europe. It was essentially under the influence of the government in the major countries. In Europe, the Jesuits were expelled. The Enlightenment mocked and criticised the Catholic Church politically, and the bourgeoisie received no protection. The Austrian Empire had a large Catholic population, but the government took possession of all Church lands. The peasant classes remained religious, but they had no say in the matter. The 1790s French Revolution had a disastrous effect on France, effectively eliminating the Catholic Church, capturing and trading its lands, closing monasteries and schools, and banishing many of its leaders.
